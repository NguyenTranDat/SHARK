990	20	i mean, he's not looking for a fling.	Explain	00:14:14,603	00:14:16,354	bigbang	Penny
990	21	i would not say that.	Oppose	00:14:20,651	00:14:21,776	bigbang	Sheldon

990	36	now, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.	Introduce	00:15:32,139	00:15:41,606	bigbang	Sheldon
990	37	i'm sorry, i don't get the point.	Apologise	00:15:46,654	00:15:48,196	bigbang	Penny
